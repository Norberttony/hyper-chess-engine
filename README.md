# Hyper Active

Hyper Active is a chess variant engine specifically designed for Hyper Chess, a variant of the more popular Ultima Chess.

The [linked website](https://www.carusos.org/Hyperchess/hyperchess.html) provides the rules of Hyper Chess implemented in this chess engine. The non-MIT rules (where the death squares formed by the king and coordinator do not persist) are used.

In addition, the programs to generate a de Bruijn sequence and to generate magic numbers for rook and bishop moves should be build-able.
